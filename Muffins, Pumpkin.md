# Pumpkin Bread

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 6 tbsp butter
- 6 tbsp vegetable shortening
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 lb fresh pumpkin puree

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325°F and line muffin trays.

With a mortar and pestle, grind the cloves, cinnamon, and salt until a uniform texture is obtained.

In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the contents of the mortar with the flour, baking soda, and baking powder.

In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until just blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, a few minutes. Beat in the pumpkin. Don't worry about the texture at this stage, just make sure everything is well mixed.

Add the flour mixture and mix by hand until just combined.

Turn the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly, and bake for <i don't remember> minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the loaves cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

These can be frozen (allegedly).
