## Instructions

Melt 2 tbsp butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and serrano and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is softened and onion begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garam masala, coriander, cumin and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add water and tomato paste and whisk until no lumps of tomato paste remain. Add sugar and 1 tsp salt and bring to a boil.

Off heat, stir in cream. Using an immersion blender or blender, process until smooth, 30 to 60 seconds. Return sauce to simmer over medium heat and whisk in remaining 2 tbsp butter. Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to four days; gently reheat sauce before adding hot chicken.)

Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Combine chicken, yogurt, and remaining 1 tsp salt in a bowl and toss well to coat. Using tongs, transfer chicken to a wire rack set in aluminum foil â€” lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until chicken is evenly charred on both sides and registers 175 degrees, 16 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through broiling.

Let chicken rest for 5 minutes. While the chicken rests, warm sauce over medium-low heat. Cut chicken into 3/4-inch chunks and stir into sauce. Stir in 2 tbsp cilantro and season with salt to taste. Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with remaining 1 tbsp cilantro, and serve.
