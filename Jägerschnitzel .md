# Jägerschnitzel (Schnitzel with Mushroom Gravy)

Perfectly crispy on the outside with a tender interior and served with a delightfully rich mushroom gravy, it's no wonder this is one of Germany's most famous and beloved dishes!

## Ingredients

- Neutral-tasting oil for frying (I use avocado oil as it has a high smoke point)
- 4 boneless pork steaks or chops
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour combined with 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs
- Brown Mushroom Gravy (click for recipe)
- Chopped fresh parsley, garnish

## Instructions

1. Pound the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until 1/4 inch thick. Lightly sprinkle both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
2. Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dredge the pork chops in the flour, the egg, and the breadcrumbs, coating both sides and all edges at each stage. Be careful not to press the breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs.  (Note: Don't let the schnitzel sit in the coating or they will not be as crispy once fried - fry immediately.)  

    Note:  Some regions of Germany make Jägerschnitzel without the breading.  Simply pound the pork chops, salt and pepper them, fry them and serve them with the gravy.

3. Heat the oil to 330 degrees F (not hotter or the Schnitzel will burn before the meat is done, not lower or the Schnitzel will absorb the oil and be greasy).  Use just enough oil so that the Schnitzels "swim" in it.  Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly to a plate lined with paper towels.

4. Serve immediately topped with Homemade Brown Mushroom Gravy and garnished with chopped fresh parsley. Avoid completely drenching the Schnitzel with gravy so that much of the Schnitzel remains crispy. Serve with Homemade German Spaetzle, French fries, or Homemade Swabian Potato Salad, and with a fresh leafy green salad or German Cucumber Salad.
